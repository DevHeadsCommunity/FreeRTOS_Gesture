# **FreeRTOS Gesture Recognition**

## **Overview**
This project is designed to recognize hand gestures based on hand movements using an STM32F4 microcontroller, an MPU6050 sensor, and FreeRTOS. The system leverages data from the accelerometer and gyroscope to classify gestures with TinyML.

## **Required Components**

### **Core Components**
1. **STM32F4 Development Board**  
   A versatile microcontroller with robust I2C support and FreeRTOS compatibility.
2. **MPU6050 (6-axis Accelerometer and Gyroscope)**  
   A sensor to capture motion data (linear acceleration and angular velocity).
3. **Connecting Wires**  
   For interfacing the MPU6050 with the STM32F4 board.

### **Debugging Tools**
1. **Logic Analyzer**  
   For monitoring I2C signals and ensuring correct communication between devices.
2. **Serial Data Viewer**  
   Tools like `screen` or `picocom` to view data output over UART.
3. **Multimeter**  
   For basic electrical debugging and connectivity testing.

## **Project Roadmap**

### **1. Driver Development for I2C Peripheral**
   - Create low-level drivers to enable I2C communication between the STM32F4 board and external peripherals.
   - Verify communication with debugging tools like a logic analyzer or serial output.

### **2. MPU6050 Sensor Library**
   - Write a reusable and efficient library to interact with the MPU6050 sensor.
   - Include functions to configure the sensor, read raw data (acceleration and gyroscope), and process orientation.

### **3. Gesture Recognition Using TinyML**
   - Implement gesture recognition algorithms using machine learning (e.g., TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers).
   - Train a model with labeled gesture data and deploy it to the STM32F4 board.
   - Process real-time sensor data for accurate gesture classification.

## **Additional Features (Future Scope)**
- Support for multiple gesture recognition models.
- Integration with wireless modules (e.g., Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) to transmit recognized gestures.
- Display gesture recognition results on an LCD or send them to a mobile app.

## **Documentation and Debugging**
1. **Document Code Thoroughly**  
   Ensure every function and feature is well-documented to enhance maintainability.
2. **Debugging Setup**  
   - Use the logic analyzer to verify correct I2C communication (SDA, SCL signals).  
   - Use a serial viewer to log and visualize sensor data and debugging messages.
